# PowerOps

A free, open-source, cross-platform toolkit that brings software-engineering discipline (analysis, diffing, testing, repeatable deployment) to Microsoft Power Platform. It works alongside `pac`; it does not replace it.

**Status:** early development, Phase 0. The only command so far is `powerops analyze`.

## Install

```sh
dotnet tool install --global PowerOps
powerops --version
```

## Usage

```sh
powerops analyze                      # find solutions under . (unpacked XML folders and exported .zip files)
powerops analyze path/to/solution.zip path/to/unpacked --format json --out report.json
powerops baseline                     # accept today's findings: writes powerops-baseline.json
powerops analyze --baseline powerops-baseline.json   # report only findings that are not in the baseline
```

`analyze` is offline and read-only. Options: `--format text|json|sarif` (default `text`), `--out <file>` (write the report to a file instead of stdout), `--fail-on error|warning|none` (default `error`), `--baseline <file>` (drop findings listed in a baseline file before reporting and before the exit code; the summary counts them as `baselined`). The YAML source layout is not supported yet.

`baseline [path...] [--out <file>]` runs the same analysis and writes the findings it found to a JSON file (default `powerops-baseline.json`). A finding matches the baseline on solution unique name, rule id, component and message, not on file, so a baseline made from an exported zip also works for the unpacked folder. An unreadable or invalid baseline file is a usage error (exit `2`).

Exit codes: `0` no findings at or above `--fail-on`, `1` findings at or above it, `2` usage error (bad option, missing path, no solutions found), `3` unreadable solution or internal error (set `POWEROPS_DEBUG=1` for a stack trace).

| Rule | Severity | Finds |
|---|---|---|
| PO001 | error | Flow uses a connection reference that is not defined in the solution or its dependencies |
| PO002 | error | Required environment variable has neither a default nor a current value |
| PO003 | error | Missing dependency that no solution owns |
| PO004 | error | Flow calls a child flow that is not in the solution or its dependencies |
| PO005 | warning | Connection reference not used by any flow or canvas app |
| PO006 | warning | Flow contains a hard-coded environment or SharePoint URL |
| PO007 | warning | Environment variable default looks environment-specific (URL, GUID, email) |
| PO008 | warning | Environment variable current value is shipped in the solution |
| PO009 | warning | Component name uses a prefix other than the publisher's |
| PO010 | warning | Default or generated publisher |
| PO011 | warning | Cloud flow is turned off |
| PO012 | warning | Dataverse row-updated trigger has no filter columns |
